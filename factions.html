            <h2 id="church-of-tempus">The Church of Tempus</h2>
            <p>
                The Church of Tempus is the <i>de facto</i> governmental authority in The Vertebrae, and the largest and most influential religious group. It issues paper currency backed by substantial gold reserves, mints metal coinage, and is in no way a democratically run institution. They operate police forces on around half of the islands in The Vertebrae, schools on 2/3 of them, and one of the two institutes of higher education and arcane study: Windshear College.
            </p>
            <h3>The Most Holy Fleet of Storms</h3>
            <p>
                Colloquially known as the "Stormfleet", or more derisively as "Stormies", the Most Holy Fleet is the military arm of the Church of Tempus, and its leaders are the highest ranking and most powerful members of the Church full stop.
            </p>
            <p>
                They have a rigid military hierarchy, led by a triad of elected-for-life figures who renounce their previous identities and connections to take on the personae of The Eye of The Storm, The Great Howling Wind, and The Ceaseless Torrent. The Eye is always a ship’s captain, The Wind always a navigational officer, and The Torrent always a marine. The practice and scripture of the Church of Tempus dictates that these are eternal figures, and that once one has taken on the identity of one of the triad, there is no distinction between them and all previous holders of the title. Officers within the fleet are universally divine magic users of some variety: their ships are always captained by tempest clerics, their marine troops always lead by paladins. The rank and file, though, draws from almost every population group and social stratum in the Vertebrae, since serving with the Stormfleet is one of the better paying jobs available to almost anyone regardless of education or social standing, and serving for a decade guarantees you a sizeable pension, which makes it a very tempting option.
            </p>
            <h3>OPIR</h3>
            <p>
                The Office of Particular Investigations and Reconnaisance, OPIR, is a nominally civillian agency, tasked with intelligence gathering, investigations targeting organised crime, heresy against the Church, unsanctioned use of arcane magic, and certain anti-piracy operations. They work closely with the Stormfleet, but are very specifically not a military order (despite being comprised universally of Inquisitor paladins) for the reason that they do not adhere to the codes of conduct and honour that the fleet unwaveringly enforce on its men.
            </p>
            <p>
                The law does not apply to them, but they make <i>sure</i> it applies to you.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Depending on who you ask, the Stormfleet, and the Church more generally, are either the honourable maintainers of law and order, or an oppressive fundamentalist force. The Stormfleet claims all of the Vertebrae as being under their protection, but in reality their influence wanes significantly as one moves southwest down the island chain, with more and more ports being more and more sympathetic to or openly supportive of pirates.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2 id="the-co-op">The Cooperative of Associated Trades</h2>
            <p>
                The second largest naval and pseudo-governmental force in the Vertebrae, “The Co-op” is an organisation made up of various wealthy merchant guilds and trading companies, who banded together to support and protect themselves without paying tithe to the Church of Tempus and thus qualify their vessels for protection by the Stormfleet. They do not issue paper currency, but do mint coins of the same weights and denominations as the Church, and the two are considered largely interchangeable. One might encounter some awkwardness and hemming and hawing attempting to use Co-op coinage in a particularly heavily Church-influenced town, but generally nobody would actively refuse to take it.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a business owner, membership in the Co-op gives one access to insurance both of ships and their cargo, and the ability to hire either marines billeted on your own ships, or escort vessels. The leadership of the Co-op is an assembly of representatives, one each from the various guilds and large trading companies, and decisions are made by quorum.
            </p>
            <h3>The Trade Navy</h3>
            <p>
                A less disciplined and organised force militarily than the Stormfleet by far, The Co-op’s paramilitary wing, the Trade Navy, scoops up a mixture of individuals who washed out of Stormfleet training, people who want to get rich quicker than the 10-year service contract with the Stormfleet allows, and ex-pirates trying to “go straight” who lack skills outside of naval combat. Users of magic are much less common among the Trade Navy, and tend more towards storm or sea sorcerers, and wizards trained in one of the two mage colleges in the Vertebrae.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Similarly to the Stormfleet, opinions on the Co-op are divided. For many, they are a force for good, regulating and protecting business interests, and ensuring that trade continues to function profitably for everyone involved. For others, they are a monopolistic protection racket, squeezing smaller businesses dry to line their own pockets.
